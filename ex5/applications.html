							A typical forensic process includes the acquisition and analysis of an inspected digital media. After the investigation, 
							a digital forensics analyst has to create a report that will include all the collected evidence, every procedure that 
							he/she followed and a conclusion regarding the investigation.

							Digital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. First, with digital forensics investigations, valuable
							crime evidence can be collected and prove oneâ€™s innocence or the opposite. Furthermore, the identification of the source 
							of media (for example, in copyright cases), or determine the authenticate of documents have been proved to be very 
							valuable in solving civil crime cases. The most common usage of digital evidence is to support or reverse a hypothesis 
							before criminal or civil courts.
