						For someone to proceed with a career as a digital forensics analyst one must first have a bachelor’s 
						degree in computer science relevant field. The field of digital forensics needs good pre-existing 
						knowledge for several aspects of computer science such as connectivity, networking, basic hardware 
						knowledge, algorithmic thinking, etc. A Master’s in digital forensics and cybersecurity is the next 
						step for a career in this field. Since this scientific field is very new not a lot of universities 
						have a program for it and when they do their tuitions are very expensive. For this reason, when someone
						chooses to follow this career path they must find a Master’s program that suits them.

						In my opinion, a good program should prepare you to meet real-world challenges and develop investigative problem-solving skills. A Master’s in this field should be very technical and offer a lot of practice 
						scenarios that youcan analyze complex data, examine digital media and write detailed reports. Upon the 
						completion of such a program, one can be gain the title of digital forensics analyst and can help the 
						government, businesses and law enforcement organizations in detecting data breached, mitigate cyberattacks 
						and investigate/evaluate evidence of digital crimes.
